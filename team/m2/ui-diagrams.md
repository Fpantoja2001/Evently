Here is the Login UI, which contains a landing page and the first page of the login. On the landing page you will find an animation on the left side, and login/sign-up buttons on the right side. 

Upon clicking the Login button, it will lead you to the page where you'll be greeted with welcome back text above an email input field and continue button. Below it will be a sign-up link if they haven't signed up yet, and a sign-up with Google button.
