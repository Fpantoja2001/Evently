# Event TBD

## Problem Description:

Modern day's fast-paced and socially dispersed world makes it difficult for people to meet others and participate in activities that suit their interests. People frequently find it challenging to locate events whether it be business conferences, social get-togethers, or leisure pursuits. There are existing solutions for this problem, but they are scattered across multiple platforms, don't have enough user engagement elements, or don't offer enough changes for social interaction prior to, during, and following the event. It doesn't give the users the opportunity for networking, social fulfillment, and personal growth. 

## Proposed Solution:

We want to introduce an app for event organizers and attendees that makes it simple for people to discover different events (including but not limited to parties, conferences, and social gathers) according to their preferences. Users will be able to see event data, such as location and a heat map of participants, RSVP or indicate their involvement, and communicate with other attendees or the host through the app. 

## Why This Matters

By providing these features, the app will encourage users to participate in activities that align with their interests or professional goals, which will enhance their social experiences and expand their personal and professional networks. It will also help users make connections, friendships, and networking opportunities.
